The aim is to build a polyglot microservice architecture, with most of the greatness of UB, with focus on performance at scale, ease of use and stability. V3 Aims to be composable and reusable building blocks for microservices.
Currently, we do support `Typescript` only. Ultimate Backend was greatly influenced by Spring Boot and as such
some API might closely similar.

## Design Principle

Ultimate Backend borrows popular known architecture and patterns for building microservice as modular packages that
can be imported into a project.

Ultimate Backend Typescript is tightly coupled with [NestJs](https://nestjs.com). To learn more about
